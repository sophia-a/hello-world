# hello-world

Hello. I'm Sophia and I hate introductions and "tell us a bit about yourself". It's a guaranteed way to wipe someone's memory of all the things that make them interesting, and reduce them down to "I like sport" or "I watch Netflix" or - worst of all - "I prefer dogs over cats". Nevertheless, here's some things I like:
- Cats
- Netflix
- Running
- Cooking and baking
- Astrophysics
